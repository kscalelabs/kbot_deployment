# A bunch of random deployment shit

- `scripts` has diagnostic & helper scripts, hopefully with reasonable names
- `scripts/run` is for running the firmware, give it the policy as an argument
- `deploy_from_queue` does what it says on the tin. make sure `klog-robot` is installed (you should be able to run `klog-deploy`)
- there should be a `policies` directory in here
